              <p>
                The South O Block Party began as a simple gathering hosted by Dave Boudreau, bringing together close friends and neighbors on a sunny street in South Oceanside. What started as a laid-back hangout quickly grew into something much bigger ‚Äî a true community celebration.The South O Block Party was born from a simple idea: bring people together
              </p>
              <p>
                Now an annual tradition, the South O Block Party showcases a diverse lineup of local bands, vibrant art from talented local artists, and mouthwatering food from favorite neighborhood vendors. At its heart, the event is about connection ‚Äî a day to come together, celebrate creativity, support small businesses, and enjoy the unique spirit of South O.
              </p>
              <p>
                Coming off the success of the 2025 event, we‚Äôre already looking ahead to 2026 with even more excitement. This year, we‚Äôre expanding ‚Äî with more space, more music, more art, and more ways to bring the community even closer together.
                We believe in supporting local artists, fostering community connections, and creating 
                unforgettable experiences that celebrate the unique culture and beauty of Oceanside.
              </p>
              <p>
